## Warp

> Also not recommended for production _yet_

This project was inspired by chimney [https://github.com/aosasona/chimney](https://github.com/aosasona/chimney). 

It's also an attempt to deeply understand the inner workings of http/mimetypes/request lifecycle and more. 
##### Deployed with warp 
  [https://larchive-fe.fly.dey](https://larchive-fe.fly.dev) on [https://fly.io](https://fly.io)

### Why warp? 


- Rewrites work by default. No special configuration is required. 
- As tiny as possible as well 
- Logs all incoming requests *( can be disabled )*
- Accurate Mimetypes for all files
